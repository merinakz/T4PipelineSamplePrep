# Prepping the bed files fromgithub 3p-Seq run so that we can feed that data into the t4 pipeline
# Need to take the bed format and move it into a 4 column format [chrom, terminationPosition, coverage, strand] to get the single nucleotide coverage
# write pooled.3p files for each bed file to run in T4pipeline
